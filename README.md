# doom-config

My own private config for Doom Emacs Distribution.
---- 

## Installation

First begin by installing doom Emacs by following the installation guide at this address https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs.  
Then we need, to remove the default config by using the commands rm -rf ~/.doom.d  
After that just type the commands `git clone https://github.com/DreydenGys/doom-config.git ~/.doom.d` to clone the config from the repo.
